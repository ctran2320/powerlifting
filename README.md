# Powerlifting Competition Analysis
## Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charlie.tran3526/viz/uspa/SummaryDashboard

## Goal: Implement webscraping via Python's BeautifulSoup & Request libraries to generate a robust dataset that consists of powerlifting competition data for every competition for the USPA & USAPL federations. Website to scrape: https://www.openpowerlifting.org/. Visualize data in a Tableau dashboard that showcases the rising popularity of powerlifting as a sport for the top 2 federations in the U.S, the strength trends year over year and a way to show individiual lifters where they match up against their competition.
